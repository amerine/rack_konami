{"name":"Rack::Konami","body":"## Rack::Konami\r\n\r\nA Rack middleware component that embeds the Konami Code in your app and lets you fade in and out a snippet of html. \r\n\r\n### Requirements \r\nIt requires JQuery 1.4.0 or greater.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install rack_konami\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n```\r\nrequire 'rack_konami'\r\nuse Rack::Konami, :html => \"<img src='/images/rails.png'>\"\r\napp = lambda { |env| [200, { 'Content-Type' => 'text/html' }, '<html><body><p>Awesome Body</p></body></html>'] }\r\nrun app\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Rails 3.x / Sinatra\r\nIn your Gemfile \r\n\r\n```\r\ngem \"rack_konami\"\r\n```\r\n\t\r\nIn your config.ru\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse Rack::Konami, :html => '<img src=\"/images/rails.png\" >', :delay => '1500'\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen your browser and type ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓  ← →  ← → B A  ↵\r\n\t\r\n### TODO\r\n* It probably wouldn't hurt to have more tests. \r\n* Add support for embedding the asynchronous tracking code.\r\n\r\n### Note on Patches/Pull Requests\r\n \r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a\r\n  future version unintentionally.\r\n* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.\r\n  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)\r\n* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n\r\n### Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2010 Mark Turner.
